    """Create a permission policy for a specific community's restricted fields.

    Creates a permission policy for editing restricted fields. The policy
    furnishes just one action: "edit_restricted_field".

    Args:
        community_id: The ID of the community to create the permission policy for.
        roles: A list of roles to create the permission policy for.

    Note:
        If the community ID is not provided or is "default", the system default policy
        will be returned. This allows only system process and admins.

        If the provided `roles` list is a list of strings, the roles will be
        converted to the corresponding built-in generators. If the list is a
        list of invenio_records_permissions.generators.Generator objects, the
        generators will be used directly. If the list is empty, the default
        policy will be returned.

        If a community ID is provided, but the `roles` list is empty, the policy
        will be a default community policy that allows owners, managers, and
        curators to edit restricted fields.

    Returns:
        A permission policy for the community's restricted fields.
