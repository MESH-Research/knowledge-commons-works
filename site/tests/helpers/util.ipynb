In this paper I examine the earlier stage of his thought, which would serve as the basis for researching his later thought, by analyzing the discourse 'Religious Fire and National Spirit [esh dat ve'ruch leumi]'. Alexandrov is referring to the polemic between Ahad Ha'am (Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg) and Moshe Leib Lilienblum which stirred up the Jewish national movement at the time. He takes the side of Ahad Ha'am, and call upon him and his fellows to join in a new national-interpretive initiative. In Alexandrov's opinion the contradiction between religious life and the sciences and enlightenment finds its dialectic culmination in Nationalism, which embodies authenticity, morality and rationality. National life will replace religious life, which hinges solely upon reward and punishment. Like Ahad Ha'am, Alexandrov combines a striving to modernize Judaism with a call to return to the traditional sources which carry its national values. For this purpose he wishes to establish a Religious-Academic institution in Jerusalem, which will engage in reinterpreting traditional sources in such a way as to remold Judaism.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Rabbi Shmuel Alexandrov is a fascinating yet neglected thinker. In this paper I examine the earlier stage of his thought, which would serve as the basis for researching his later thought, by analyzing the discourse 'Religious Fire and National Spirit [esh dat ve'ruch leumi]'. Alexandrov is referring to the polemic between Ahad Ha'am (Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg) and Moshe Leib Lilienblum which stirred up the Jewish national movement at the time. He takes the side of Ahad Ha'am, and call upon him and his fellows to join in a new national-interpretive initiative. In Alexandrov's opinion the contradiction between religious life and the sciences and enlightenment finds its dialectic culmination in Nationalism, which embodies authenticity, morality and rationality. National life will replace religious life, which hinges solely upon reward and punishment. Like Ahad Ha'am, Alexandrov combines a striving to modernize Judaism with a call to return to the traditional sources which carry its national values. For this purpose he wishes to establish a Religious-Academic institution in Jerusalem, which will engage in reinterpreting traditional sources in such a way as to remold Judaism.\",\n",
