                "There are three main East Asian approaches to "

                "Victorian pictorialization of Ophelia, "
                "especially John Everett Millais’s famous "
                "Ophelia (1851), that emphasized, as Kimberly "
                "Rhodes describes, her “pathos, innocence, and "
                "beauty rather than the unseemly detail of her "
                "death.”  Despite having lived through negative "
                "experiences, Ophelia retains a childlike "
                "innocence in these rewritings. For example, New "

                "with and even critique the Victorian narrative "
                "tradition of moralization. Late "
                "nineteenth-century translator Lin Shu "
                "(1852-1924), for example, tones down the "
                "sentimentalization of Ophelia in his classical "
                "Chinese rewriting of Charles and Mary Lamb’s "
                "Tales from Shakespeare, showcasing the conflict "

                "There are three main East Asian approaches to "
                "interpreting Ophelia. The first is informed by "
                "the fascination with and reaction against the "
                "Victorian pictorialization of Ophelia, "
                "especially John Everett Millais's famous "
                "Ophelia (1851), that emphasized, as Kimberly "
                'Rhodes describes, her "pathos, innocence, and '
                "beauty rather than the unseemly detail of her "
                'death." Despite having lived through negative '
                "experiences, Ophelia retains a childlike "
                "innocence in these rewritings. For example, New "
                "Hamlet by Lao She (penname of Shu Qingchun, "
                "1899-1966) parodies China's "
                '"Hamlet complex" '
                "(the inability to act at a time of national "
                "crisis) and the fascination with an Ophelia "
                "submerged in water. Both Ophelia and Millais's "
                "painting are featured in two of Japanese writer "
                "Natsume Sōseki's early twentieth-century "
                "novels. A second approach emphasizes the local "
                "context. Adapters used local values to engage "
                "with and even critique the Victorian narrative "
                "tradition of moralization. Late "
                "nineteenth-century translator Lin Shu "
                "(1852-1924), for example, tones down the "
                "sentimentalization of Ophelia in his classical "
                "Chinese rewriting of Charles and Mary Lamb's "
                "Tales from Shakespeare, showcasing the conflict "
                "between Victorian and Confucian moral codes. "
                "The third approach focuses upon an objectified "
                "and sexualized Ophelia. As other chapters in "
                "this volume demonstrate, this is not "
                "exclusively an Asian phenomenon. However, the "
                "eroticism associated with the Ophelia figure in "
                "a number of Asian stage and screen versions of "
                "Hamlet, such as Sherwood Hu's film Prince of "
                "the Himalayas (2006), aligns Ophelia with East "
                "Asian ideals of femininity, but also brings out "
                "the sexuality that is latent or suppressed in "
                "Victorian interpretations. They do so by "
                "aligning Ophelia with East Asian ideals of "
                "femininity."
