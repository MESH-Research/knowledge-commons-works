                "Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have "
                "evolved a finely tuned coordination between, on "
                "the one hand, modular dimensions for street "
                "widths and lot sizes, and on the other, a "
                "typology of room shapes and layouts within "
                "houses. Despite being well documented in urban "
                "history, this coordination was in the last "
                "century often interpreted as contingent, a "
                "result of the limited material means of "
                "pre-industrial societies. But the continued "
                "application and gradual adaptation of these "
                "urban and architectural patterns through "
                "periods of industrialization and economic "
                "development suggests that they respond both to "
                "enduring housing requirements and to piecemeal "
                "urban growth. This article surveys the "
                "persistence of urban and architectural patterns "
                "up to the early 20th century, showing their "
                "resilience in addressing modern housing and "
                "urbanization requirements."
