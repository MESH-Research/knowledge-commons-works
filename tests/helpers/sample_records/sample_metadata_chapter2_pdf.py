            "The issue of gender has been a topic of "
            "discussion in the research of Hasidism since S. "
            "A. Horodecky’s book (1923), in which he claimed "
            "that Hasidism brought about full equality of "
            "Jewish men and women in the field of "
            "spirituality. Although his claims have been by "
            "and large rejected, most\n"
            "scholars agree that the twentieth century Chabad "
            "movement has indeed created space for women in "
            "the hasidic model of spirituality. This article "
            "sets out to explore whether the particular "
            "interest of contemporary Chabad in the role of "
            "women is a new phenomenon or has existed from "
            "the movement’s inception. Rather than looking at "
            "the issue from a social-historical perspective, "
            "the article examines the gender discourse "
            "conveyed in the homilies of the founder of "
            "Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi "
            "(1745–1812). It explores the role of the "
            "feminine aspect of divinity in the process of "
            "creation, and its envisioned elevation in the "
            "future-to-come, in an attempt to establish the "
            "relation between the gender category of “female” "
            "and flesh-and-blood women in the teachings of "
            "Shneur Zalman of Liadi. This, in turn, leads to "
            "determine whether the concept of the "
            "transfigurations of genders in the "
            "future-to-come, a Chabad tradition that "
            "originates in the teachings of Shneur Zalman of "
            "Liadi and serves as the ideological ground for "
            "the empowerment of Chabad women in the writings "
            "of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe in the twentieth "
            "century, could have any relevance to the daily "
            "life of wives and daughters of Shneur Zalman’s "
            "followers."
