  FIXME: This file is a shim to allow sections of the Invenio UI that reference
  the standard detail template to work with the KCWorks custom detail template
  provided in invenio-modular-detail-page. The detail template is supposed
  to be overridable via a config variable, but the requests templates do not
  use the config variable to reference the detail template.
