{{ _('Welcome %(email)s', email=user.email) }} to Knowledge Commons Works, the open access repository for Knowledge Commons! With KCWorks ({{ config.get("SITE_UI_URL") }}), you can:

- Mint DOIs for every work you upload
- Share your works through feeds to Google Scholar, core.ac.uk, and other metadata aggregators
- Create multiple versions of one work, and add multiple files within one record
- Contribute to collections of similar works
- Control the metadata you’d like to share about a work, and hide works that are outdated

KCWorks is currently in public beta, which means the repository is fully functional, but we’re still tweaking things behind the scenes. Use this form to provide us with feedback: {{ config.get("KC_CONTACT_FORM_URL") }}

Happy sharing!
